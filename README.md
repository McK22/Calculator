# Calculator works for non-negative integers.
# Supported operations: +, *, ^, /, number system conversion.
# To describe an operation in an input file put an operation symbol (+, *, ^ or /) followed by a space and a number system.
# After that write two numbers in two separate lines in the appropriate number system.
# Each two lines should be separated by an empty line.
# Example:
# + 16
# 
# 234BF4F7A
# 
# 234BB6B7C3
#
# In order to perform a number system conversion one needs to put two number systems and a number written in the first of the two systems. It will be
# converted two the second number system.
# Example:
# 10 2
#
# 49235349569
# 
# In order to run the program add the input file name after the execute file name
# Each operation description will be rewritten to the output file with the result of the operation.
# If you also add "manyFiles", each operation will be rewritten to a different file.
